# StudyMaxx

StudyMaxx is a smart, centralized learning companion that empowers students to take charge of their academic success. It generates personalized learning plans, tracks study performance, and fosters motivation through data-driven visualizations and gamified features like leaderboards.

## Why StudyMaxx?

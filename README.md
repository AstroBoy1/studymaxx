#StudyMaxx

StudyMaxx is a smart, centralized learning companion that empowers students to take charge of their academic success. It generates personalized learning plans, tracks study performance, and fosters motivation through data-driven visualizations and gamified features like leaderboards.

The idea was born from recognizing how disjointed modern studying can beâ€”students juggle calendars, task managers, chatbots, and learning resources across different platforms. Our goal was to centralize the essential academic tools into one clean interface that integrates planning, progress tracking, and intelligent recommendations.
